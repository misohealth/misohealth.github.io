about:
  - I have over 10 years’ experience across private practice, aged care and non-profit settings in both the Netherlands and Australia. Working in different countries and across cultures has provided me with strong interpersonal skills. I value the importance of including my patients in decision making, empowering them through education about optimal management and encouraging them to develop self-management strategies. I can work well independently, but also love working in a team. I have recently started growing my skills in applying insights from Acceptance and Commitment therapy into my work and am expanding my knowledge about Women’s Health.
